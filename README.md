# Roblox-ESP-and-Tracers
This is a script for Roblox that provides ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) and Tracers functionality. ESP allows you to see other players' names and distances from you through walls and other obstacles. Tracers draw a line from your character to other players, making it easier to locate them.
